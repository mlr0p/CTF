2017 34C3 Junior CTF
===========

Here are the writeups for the challenges that I solved at 34C3 Junior CTF in 2017.

Considering myself as a noob in CTF, I did okay in the contest, finishing up 101 in 435 teams.

However there are skills that I need to brush up on.

1. Learn C. Without any knowledge of C, it is impossible for me to solve all the pwn challenges, (solved only the buffer
overflow one since that was the only thing I knew about C exploits)
2. Go through cryptography methods. I was stuck on the AES encryption using known IV (Ecoin challenge) and AES CBC mode
(cyberms challenge)
3. Go through ARM assembly tutorials on https://azeria-labs.com/ as it's useful to know
4. Keep participating and practicing!!
