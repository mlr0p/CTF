2017 34C3 Junior CTF
===========

Here are the writeups for the challenges that I solved at 34C3 Junior CTF in 2017.

Finished 101 in 435 teams, need to learn more.

SOme skills that I need to brush up on.

1. Learn C
2. Go through cryptography methods. I was stuck on the AES encryption using known IV (Ecoin challenge) and AES CBC mode
(cyberms challenge)
3. Go through ARM assembly tutorials on https://azeria-labs.com/ as it's useful to know
